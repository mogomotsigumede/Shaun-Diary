<p> But the WHO said that the warning in January 2020 was more important than declaring it a pandemic in March that same year. The WHO said that it was most stunned by the lack of urgency in relation to the organisation's highest level of alert of international law. By this time two years ago, the number of cases outside of China had increased 13-fold and more than 118,000 people infected in 114 countries.Sadly, over 4,000 people had lost their lives already.
